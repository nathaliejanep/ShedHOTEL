          To process your data, as well as for the maintenance and support of
          our IT systems, we call upon subcontractors (service providers) based
          in Switzerland and abroad. When our subcontractors’ servers are
          located abroad, we ensure that they are set up in a state where the
          legislation with regard to data protection is equivalent to the FDPL
          and the GDPR and that our subcontractors apply organizational and
          technical measures that comply with both the latter.

          We undertake to ensure a high level of security with regard to data
          collection, processing and conservation by applying organizational and
          technical measures and by taking all the necessary and useful
          precautions with regard to the nature of personal data with which you
          may agree to provide us and the risks that its processing represent in
          order to maintain security and in particular prevent it from being
          altered, damaged, destroyed or made available to unauthorized third
          parties. We would nonetheless like to draw your attention to the fact
          that it is impossible to guarantee complete protection and we suggest
          you apply good practices in order to contribute to the security of
          your data.

        <h3>7. Cookies & Plugins</h3>
        <p>
          Our site uses cookies and plugins which may tend to record data
          automatically. Using them makes browsing the site more pleasant by
          improving its ergonomics based on the data collected. This data may
          also be used for statistical purposes, analyzing the behavior of
          internet users and geo-localization with the aim of personalizing our
          sales offer. When you browse our site, the computer you are using
          dialogues with a server which provides it with all the required
          resources by automatically recording every operation in a specific
          file in which the computer used is identified by its IP address. This
          is how the browser you use sends us certain standard data, notably
          about the browser used and its functionalities, the operating system
          of the computer, tablet or smartphone used, third-party sites (such as
          Facebook) from which you may have connected as well as the dates and
          times our site was accessed. This data and especially the IP address
          from which you are connected do not allow us to identify you by name.
          Should you open a page of our website containing one social media
          plugins such as Facebook, your internet browser will establish a
          direct connection with the social network server. The content of the
          plugin is directly transmitted by the social network concerned to your
          internet browser and incorporated to the web page by the latter.
          Thanks to the inclusion of cookies on our website pages, the social
          network concerned is informed that you have consulted one or more
          pages on our website. If you are connected to a social network when
          you visit our site, this is capable of attributing your visit to our
          site with your account with them. Should you interact with the
          plugins, by clicking on the “Like” button for example, or by
          commenting, the corresponding information is sent directly by your
          internet browser to the social network and recorded on their servers.
          To understand the purpose and extent of the collection and processing
          of data by the social networks of which you are a member, as well as
          your rights in this regard and the settings options of your account so
          that you can protect your private life, we advise you to consult their
          privacy policy.
        </p>
